             the concept is the following: inorder to apply certain filters on a given image, 
             the image must contain at least a - well chosen - number of pixels, because 
             if that number was too low, the outcome of the filter applied on to the image 
             would not be as expected, so we need to increase the number of pixels,
             and that is by resizing it ( upscaling it ), at the same time we do not want the 
             image to get too big, so that it can be processed faster, and then we won't end 
             up having huge files.
